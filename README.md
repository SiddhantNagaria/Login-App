# Login-App

I have created a login app with two pages of login and signup having functionalitites of username and password.
I have used kotlin language and used Android Studio for creating this App. 
This app has an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to navigate through the login process.

The username and password both is - admin . If you enter other details then an error will be prompted.

This app also has a sleek design that is both modern and professional and simple.
